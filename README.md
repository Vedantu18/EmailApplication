ðŸ˜Ž


## 4. How To Use:

To send emails:

1. without authentication -> Run in IDE -> ```src/main/java/com/application/SimpleEmail.java```, 
2. with TLS Authentication -> Run in IDE -> ```src/main/java/com/application/TLSEmail.java```,
3. with SSL Authentication and Email attachment and image Run in IDE -> ```src/main/java/com/application/SSLEmail.java```.


## 5. JavaMail API Troubleshooting Tips: 

1. ```java.net.UnknownHostException``` comes when your system is not able to resolve the IP address for the SMTP server, it might be wrong or not accessible from your network. For example, GMail SMTP server is ```smtp.gmail.com``` and if I use ```smtp.google.com```, I will get this exception. If the hostname is correct, try to ping the server through command line to make sure itâ€™s accessible from your system.

2. If your program is stuck in Transport send() method call, check that SMTP port is correct. If itâ€™s correct then use telnet to verify that itâ€™s accessible from you machine, you will get output like below.
